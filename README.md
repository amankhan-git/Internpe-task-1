ðŸš€ First Task Completed! ðŸš€

I'm excited to share that I've completed my first task during my internship at Internpe: building a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This project allowed me to:

1.Enhance my front-end development skills
2.Work with HTML to structure the calculator
3.Use CSS to style it and make it look attractive
4.Implement JavaScript for the calculator's functionality
